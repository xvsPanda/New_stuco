# Webdev

## Workflow

Local Web/Mobile requests follow Work Locally for rediscovery and managed-versus-plain-local choice before entering this Addon workflow.
Respect that choice; local Game keeps its existing managed workflow.

Use the project and setup state returned by init/attach. Continue an attached project's current
request and accepted decisions without repeating initialization or planning. Project-file locators
are relative to the returned project directory; documentation links are relative to this Skill’s directory.
Game follows its delivered Game workflow. Web and Mobile share the common workflow and tool
rules below. Each selected template README adds its specific facts and
overrides; [Mobile](templates/expo/README.md) owns the fixed starter, device/backend, development
and app-build workflow. Web-specific setup, routing and publication rules do not apply to Mobile.

### 1. Plan

For infrastructure and services needed by the task, default to Manus-provided capabilities
unless the user explicitly requests an alternative.

Before planning, select required guides from the [guide facts](#planning-read-set) and user request.
Read known paths in one parallel tool-call batch; reuse complete guidance in context.

When you write an implementation plan, keep implementation and design decisions in one `plan.md`.
Explain how to implement the requested product and
how its parts fit together: the implementation approach, dependencies, material constraints,
and frontend/backend serving. Preserve concrete requirements and distinguish required behavior
from optional ideas.

Include a project structure section in the plan, describing the main folders, modules, and
their responsibilities. Ground these decisions in the project's actual capabilities, template
guidance and existing files. Small changes reuse the existing plan and design; do not introduce a new planning pass just to satisfy this Skill.

Revise changed planning assumptions before implementation. Keep the plan focused on implementation
and necessary design decisions. Do not add a separate validation plan or acceptance checklist,
or turn product requirements into step-by-step test tasks.

#### Design

Follow the design style chosen in the Blueprint. Without a chosen Blueprint style, use the
user's style guidance or reference if supplied; otherwise choose one style directly.
Expand that style in the implementation plan, in the user's language, covering:

- **Design Movement**: Reference a specific aesthetic.
- **Core Principles**: 3–4 defining characteristics that guide all design decisions.
- **Color Philosophy**: The palette's reasoning and emotional intent, not just color values.
- **Layout Paradigm**: A distinctive structural approach; avoid grid-based centralized layouts
  as much as possible.
- **Signature Elements**: 2–3 distinctive visual motifs used throughout.
- **Interaction Philosophy**: How interactions reflect the design ethos.
- **Animation**: Detailed animation guidelines that reflect the design ethos.
- **Typography System**: Specific font pairings and hierarchy rules that embody the style.
- **Brand Essence**: One-line positioning (what it is, who it is for, why it is different)
  plus 3 personality adjectives.
- **Brand Voice**: How headlines, CTAs and microcopy sound, with 2 example lines. Avoid generic
  filler such as "Welcome to our website" or "Get started today".
- **Wordmark & Logo**: A distinctive logotype/mark concept, not the brand name in a default font.
- **Signature Brand Color**: One ownable color that is unmistakably this brand's.

Keep this design description in `plan.md`.

### 2. ToDo

After plan approval, create the native `todo` before configuration or implementation. Replace
preliminary phase headings with outcome items using `action=create`; retain existing progress
only where the same outcome has already been delivered. Carry the
actual acceptance clauses from the request and approved plan into outcome items; copy clear
source clauses rather than summarizing them. If native `todo` is unavailable, use project
`TODO.md` with the same complete clauses, not one-line feature headings. Preserve concrete values, messages, field rules, actors, transitions
and exceptions, using the original request where the plan omitted or weakened a requirement.
Exclude secret API keys and implementation rationale from the copied clauses.

Put each outcome heading and its complete criteria in `title`, the item's only text field;
summaries or links to the plan do not substitute for these clauses. For unstructured requests,
identify independently deliverable outcomes before grouping. Merge duplicate clauses, keep
distinct feature groups separate, and avoid both a single whole-application item and an item per
field. Do not force a tiny item count. Before creating the list, compare it with the source:
every required condition must remain explicit, with duplicates consolidated rather than generalized.
Preserve IDs and full criteria on status updates. Acceptance clauses describe product
behavior, not additional tests. Reuse code and existing evidence; do not add a separate testing
task for every product requirement. Mark an item complete only with evidence of its outcome;
keep unresolved outcomes open. For complex tasks, include the validation agent described below.

### 3. Implement

Prefer a well-defined project structure over writing a very large amount of code in a single file.
Write readable source code in the project's existing style, with appropriate line breaks and indentation for the language.

#### Login in embedded Preview

For any website with cookie-based login, **set the application's session cookie to
`SameSite=None; Secure` for public HTTPS Preview**. Manus embeds Preview in a cross-site
iframe; `SameSite=Lax` or `Strict` prevents that cookie from accompanying iframe requests.
Do not select these attributes from `NODE_ENV` or the development server's internal
`req.secure`: public HTTPS can reach that server over HTTP. Keep plain-HTTP local handling separate.
Browser third-party-cookie policies can still block cross-site cookies.

#### Project-logo metadata

Platform branding is separate from site favicons and native icons. Before checkpointing, set
a quoted `logoUrl` literal in project-root `app.config.ts`, preserving existing fields;
if absent, create `export default { logoUrl: "<actual HTTPS URL>" }`.
Use a durable HTTPS asset URL or `manus-upload-file <logo-file>` without `--webdev`.
The hook reads the accepted commit and does not evaluate expressions; no import is needed.
Limits: URL 2056 characters, no credentials or outer whitespace; file 1 MiB.
Relative paths and temporary signed URLs are invalid; failed sync keeps the old logo.

#### Image assets

- Reuse suitable images supplied by the user or already in the project. If the user supplies a style reference, use it to guide the design; do not search again merely because a reference was supplied.
- When an image must depict a specific real person, product or place, use the supplied photo or search for an accurate one; do not generate a lookalike.
- For custom hero images, banners or brand illustrations, use the Agent's `generate_image` tool. For a new site, decide their page placements and submit independent image requests together before application coding. Describe the subject, composition, colors and style in each prompt. Generate only images with a planned use; honor an exact count requested by the user. Do not substitute generic stock images for these custom visuals.
- For internal tools and dashboards, skip extra decorative illustrations unless requested. This does not exclude images required by the product, such as product photos or user avatars.
- Use returned image URLs unchanged and continue independent work while generation runs. Do not poll or resubmit pending requests, or claim completion before the completion result. Do not fill unrelated sections with the same image; remove placeholder imagery before delivery.

#### File uploads

**Default to `manus-upload-file --webdev <file>`.** Upload website images and attachments to
project storage, and use the returned `/manus-storage/<key>` path in the website.

Use `manus-upload-file <file>` without `--webdev` only when the consumer requires an absolute
public URL, such as platform `logoUrl` or Shopify media ingestion. It returns a public CDN URL
independent of the Webdev project lifecycle; the project-relative path is not suitable there.
Reuse an existing suitable URL instead of uploading again.

#### Development service

Set `cwd` to the absolute `project_dir` for project commands; use `service=true` for resident
development servers. Start the server once the interface has meaningful content, and verify
readiness with an HTTP request.

Cloud uses the project's configured runtime port on `0.0.0.0`; Local uses the Session's declared
port on `127.0.0.1`. Do not automatically switch ports. Each Cloud Session has its own Sandbox;
after attach, restore missing dependencies and development services. Reuse existing healthy services.

#### Routine diagnostics

**Before writing the first batch of application code, ensure language diagnostics are configured
for the project's languages.** Inspect `webdev.config` with `GET runtime/post-edit`, reuse matching
registrations, and complete missing setup using the applicable flow below. Do not wait for a
build or typecheck failure to enable LSP.
Use the exact tool path `runtime/post-edit`, without a `config/` prefix. In Sandbox, confirm
`registered: true` and the required `languages` in the successful response before proceeding.
Absence of an edit reminder does not prove that checking completed or that the code is clean.

##### Host-managed diagnostics

When `GET runtime/post-edit` returns registered `languages`, the host owns language-server processes and checks registered project files after edits. Web and mobile starter projects register TypeScript diagnostics during initialization. Do not launch `manus-webdev-lsp` or a second native server in Sandbox.

Use `webdev.config` with `GET runtime/post-edit` to inspect the registered languages. To select project languages, use `PUT runtime/post-edit` with `{"languages":["typescript"]}` (supported: typescript, javascript, python, go, rust, json, yaml, html, css). `DELETE runtime/post-edit` removes diagnostics for this project; it does not remove its workspace or preview. Sandbox returns code diagnostics with the edit result. A pending or unavailable check is not a clean result.

The remaining instructions apply to Device and Operator runtimes where `GET runtime/post-edit` returns `servers`; these use the existing agent-managed server and MCP client.

##### Agent-managed diagnostics

Manus provides the file-edit hook and a built-in LSP client inside the Webdev MCP server. You do not install, launch, version, or configure a separate LSP client or HTTP adapter.

Manage the native server/process/settings. Presets provide prepared starting points; other standard LSP servers use the custom-server guide.

##### Start a preset

Use the `launcher` argv returned by `GET runtime/post-edit`: its runtime executable runs the supplied script. Append the subcommand and arguments shown below; `manus-webdev-lsp` in examples stands for this complete launcher, not the raw `cli_path`. Quote paths for your shell; PowerShell needs `&` before a quoted executable path. This works without a global PATH command or executable permission on the script. If no launcher is available, use the [custom-server contract](references/diagnostics.md#start-your-own-server-and-register-it).

Start the language server as a resident process using `exec` with `service: true` and an explicit project working directory:

```sh
manus-webdev-lsp start --preset typescript --project /home/ubuntu/app
```

The preset starts the server, prepares editable settings and registers/initializes the client. Its receipt reports the process, connection, file mapping, settings file and actual status. `ready` means protocol initialization succeeded, not that every edit has been checked.

Use `manus-webdev-lsp list` to discover presets and `manus-webdev-lsp describe --preset NAME` for the native settings descriptions and examples. Use `--settings /absolute/path.json` to supply your own effective protocol settings. An existing settings file must not be overwritten with preset defaults on restart.

Do not run a second HTTP `serve` process or manually repeat a successful preset registration. The resident service remains running; do not wait for it to finish as a finite task.

Resolve actionable diagnostics; if reliable LSP checking is unavailable, use the language's
existing check-only command. An actionable diagnostic on a real source file and its removal
after correction establish that a newly selected setup is checking; process readiness alone does not.
Custom server registration, native settings/reload, recovery and published logs are in
[Diagnostics](references/diagnostics.md); select that page in the planning batch when the task
already needs those operations.

#### Website route manifest

Before the first Web dev-server start, serve a static JSON document at `GET /manus-routes.json`
on the website origin, e.g. `public/manus-routes.json`. Derive the complete page route set from
current source, including nested/lazy routes and dynamic patterns such as `/todo/:id`; exclude
APIs, assets, system endpoints and 404-only routes. Keep it synchronized with route changes.

```json
{"routes":[{"path":"/","title":"Home"},{"path":"/todo/:id","title":"Todo"}]}
```

Only top-level `routes` and entry fields `path`/optional `title` are accepted. Paths must start
with `/`; queries/hashes are allowed, absolute URLs, `//`, credentials, raw whitespace and
control characters are not. Limits: 1 MiB, 1000 routes, 2048 characters per path (also after
URL encoding), 256 per title. Never truncate the set or invent entity IDs. Request the file
after startup/route changes: require HTTP 200 and this JSON, not SPA fallback HTML, and compare
with source. These page declarations are separate from published request routing below.

### 4. Validate before delivery

Prefer code inspection, automatic diagnostics and existing checks; avoid browser testing and
screenshots unless explicitly requested or needed to investigate a concrete observed defect.
For complex tasks, use one read-only `agent` with `sandbox="shared"` to check the implementation
against requirements and trace how application parts connect.
Provide the project directory, plan/ToDo, relevant platform facts and existing evidence;
the child does not inherit the parent conversation.
Fix confirmed issues and recheck affected paths; do not repeat full acceptance passes.

## Webdev tool parallelism

**DEFAULT TO PARALLEL TOOL CALLS. In EVERY response, batch ready read, write, edit, exec and
MCP calls within the host limit; mix tools and repeat the SAME tool.** Emit intended order; the
host preserves required ordering. A write alone needs no new model turn.

Wait only for a prior result needed to choose an action (unread guide, unknown config, returned
ID/status), a standalone tool (init/attach or exclusive), pending user/Host input, or unconfirmed
binding, runtime sync or checkpoint. Group up to 12 known secret keys. Do not queue competing
cards or blocked writes; do not race background/session changes to config, ports, files or Git.
**Otherwise, batch the calls.** Continue independent work during Publish without polling or duplication.

## Configuration

`webdev.config` operates the bound project; application code uses runtime APIs. The tool supplies
project identity, authentication and Skill version. Reuse init/attach facts; `GET config` before
writes, recovery or when fields are missing or concurrent changes matter.

Prefer `PUT config/{domain}` with the complete domain fragment, e.g. `{"runtime":{"port":3000}}`;
it replaces only that domain, so preserve its unchanged fields. Secret declarations change only
their named key; unrelated scoped updates do not share a project revision. Whole `PUT config`
replaces the document: include `version:1`, `runtime` and all intended fields. Read
[Configuration details](references/configuration.md) for whole-document imports or interactive
recovery. Do not combine Git transitions or
new secret candidates with unrelated changes. Integration enablement uses its dedicated route.

A successful `{ok:true,revision:N}` means stored; `runtime_sync: applied/noop` means locally
loaded. On `failed`, correct the cause and retry `GET config` once before relying on new values;
existing processes may need restart. For `revision_conflict`, inspect affected whole-document,
dependency or pending state before retry; unrelated scoped writes do not cause it. Read
`reason_code`/field errors rather than blindly repeating writes.

Use `webdev.request_secrets` for protected user input and follow its card/wait behavior. With
pending input, `blocks_config_writes:false` allows unrelated scoped writes; `true` is a legacy
all-write lock. Conflicting keys, dependencies and whole-document replacement wait or use returned
`unblock`; do not retry. `action_url` alone does not mean stop: follow Host pause/notifications.
Stripe claim is non-blocking. Completion applies the change; do not repeat a completed replacement.

Web `features` accepts only `server` and `database`. Both start off; later omitted keys preserve
effective values. `server:true` does not request a database. `database:true` also enables server
when omitted; explicitly pairing it with `server:false` is invalid. Enablement is one-way.
For requested Manus login select server during init, then read Authentication before implementation.
Game/Mobile retain their distinct [feature policies](references/features.md).

`runtime` requires `port` (1024–65535); preserve `post_edit`. Optional `endpoints` contains 1–4
distinct `{name,port}` entries; names match `^[a-z](?:[a-z0-9-]{0,30}[a-z0-9])?$` and exclude
`primary`/`preview`; ports differ from the primary port. Reserved: 5900, 5901, 8328, 8330, 8340,
8350, 9222, 9330, 19780, 50031. In Studio, only Session-local `runtime.port` is writable here;
keep GET's effective port unchanged in whole-document writes. Preview extras and recovery:
[Runtime](references/runtime.md). Configuration never starts the application for you.

## Deployment

Prepare the matching declaration while implementing; reuse valid init defaults.

| Published serving | Required config |
| --- | --- |
| Static output | `build` |
| Container | `features.server:true` and `deploy` |
| Static frontend + container backend | `build`, `features.server:true`, `deploy`, and path-splitting `routes` |

`build` is `{"build":{"command":"<self-contained install/build>","outputDirectory":"<relative directory>"}}`.
The clean checkpoint build does not implicitly install dependencies. Include the pinned toolchain/
lockfile installation when needed; output must contain `index.html`. No-build HTML uses `command:"true"`
and its committed output subdirectory. Clone, static build and upload share a five-minute budget.

`deploy` names `dockerfilePath` (default root `Dockerfile`) and required `healthPath` (unauthenticated
2xx–3xx). Store server enablement before a separate deploy write, or include both in one atomic
whole-document update. Optional top-level `buildCache` controls container image caching and
requires deploy; it defaults to enabled.

Command: nonempty, at most 1000 characters, no NUL or inline credential literals. Build output/
Dockerfile paths: repository-relative, 1–256 characters from `A-Za-z0-9._/-`, no absolute path,
`.`/`..` or empty segments, or trailing slash; symlinks stay within the repository. Health path:
starts `/`, 1–256 characters from `A-Za-z0-9._/-`, no `..` or NUL.

### Build and production runtime

Build from the recorded checkpoint, not the Sandbox working directory. The platform replaces
`.dockerignore`, excluding `node_modules`, `.git`, `.env` and `.env.*` while keeping `.env.example`.
Sandbox-installed dependencies are not image inputs.

The Dockerfile must install dependencies, compile the application and define its production
entrypoint. Container static roots must exist in the final image. Building frontend files in
the image does not publish separate static output; declare `build` for that output.
Static builds run the declared command at the repository root with the publication environment.

Do not depend on private credentials or `DATABASE_URL` being available during image compilation;
read them at runtime. Only browser-safe values may be included in frontend output.

Keep Dockerfile `EXPOSE` consistent with the application's listening port, and honor `PORT`
when supplied; use 3000 by default. The published listener is separate from Preview's
`runtime.port`; do not declare `deploy.port`. Container publication uses `healthPath` for HTTP
readiness; serve an unauthenticated success response there.

Container memory and writable files are temporary. Store durable data in the database or object
storage. New and old instances may overlap during rollout; publication is not an immediate
shutdown of the old version.

### Published routing

Published `routes` replace the whole ordered table (1–32 rules). Each rule has `path` and
`target:"static"|"server"`. Put APIs, health/webhooks and SSR pages before static catch-all.
Static needs build; server needs server capability. Read current config with
`webdev.config {"method":"GET","path":"config"}`, preserve unrelated rules, then call:

```json
{"method":"PUT","path":"config/routes","body":{"routes":[{"path":"/api/*","target":"server"},{"path":"/assets/*","target":"static","cache":"immutable"},{"path":"/*","target":"static","spaFallback":true}]}}
```

Paths begin `/`, contain `A-Z a-z 0-9 . _ ~ -` per segment, at most 256 characters, optionally
ending `/*`. Bare `/`, dot-only/empty segments, trailing slash, mid-path wildcards, queries,
fragments, whitespace, duplicates and rules shadowed by earlier wildcards are invalid.
`{}` removes the domain; an empty routes array is invalid. SPA fallback is static-only and
must not disguise missing assets/APIs. Reserved literal paths/subpaths: `/favicon.ico`,
`/manus-oauth/`, `/api/scheduled/`, `/manus-storage/`, `/__manus/`, `/__system__/`,
`/sitemap.xml`, `/robots.txt`; platform handling takes priority even under broader wildcards.
Routes apply after publication, not in Preview; no User-Agent/arbitrary-header matcher exists.

Static cache accepts `immutable`, `no-cache`, or 0–31536000 seconds. Server cache accepts
`no-cache` or 0–600 seconds (0 disables); omit to keep existing behavior. Shared server HTML
cache is only for public production GET/200 HTML outside `/api/`; Cookie/Authorization bypass,
and private/no-store/no-cache, Set-Cookie or unsupported Vary prevent storage. The application
may omit Cache-Control or send `public,max-age=0`; the platform still sends no-store to browsers.
Use shared caching only for visitor-independent content. Prefer long-lived caching for versioned
public assets, fresh/revalidated HTML, and private/no-store for sensitive responses. Detailed runtime/build failures,
CSP/HTML injection and cache verification are optional [build](references/build-contracts.md)
and [response](references/routing-and-responses.md) references.

## Checkpoints and publication

A **checkpoint** is a saved website version recorded by Manus, identified by a Git commit SHA
and shown in Version history. It records a commit accepted on `main` in the project's currently
selected repository (the canonical repository). A local commit or a push to another branch is
not a checkpoint. Saving a checkpoint and publishing it are separate operations.

Reuse the known `publishing.auto_publish` state; read `GET config` before saving only when
the state is unknown or the user asks not to publish.

- **Cloud:** For each deliverable change, commit the intended files in `project_dir`. Fetch
  `origin/main`, integrate any remote changes while preserving both sides, run affected checks,
  and push the intended commit to `origin/main`. The platform automatically records the checkpoint
  after the Git command; no separate save tool is needed. Confirm the intended SHA in the returned
  version card or Version history, not just Git exit zero.
- **Local:** Use `webdev.manus_git` under the already selected Work Locally workflow. Fetch and
  integrate its returned `<remote_refs>/main`, then push through the temporary `manus` remote;
  preserve the user's separate Git. Confirm the result's `checkpoint` is `recorded` or
  `already_recorded`. A push to the user's separate repository is not a Manus checkpoint.

Never force-push or rewrite the project's main history. After an interrupted operation, inspect
its actual result before retrying; do not repeat the whole Git command just to retry recording.

`publishing.auto_publish:true` is the user's continuing authorization for checkpoint-triggered
publication; never enable it yourself. If the user says not to publish while enabled, ask them
to turn off the Dashboard switch before a triggering push. Auto-publish completion appears in
the Dashboard; do not submit another publish for the same work. Explicit publication, rollback
and Git recovery use [Publishing, rollback and Git recovery](references/git-checkpoints.md).
MCP Publish is a background job returning its final result automatically; continue independent
work without polling.

## Delivery

For an ordinary website handoff, keep the final reply within 100 words unless detail is requested.
State the result and blockers, then give one URL: the published URL only when the delivered
version's successful publication is confirmed; otherwise the current Preview, labeled as a preview.
If none is available, say so. Preview/checkpoint success is not publication success.
Provide file attachments only when requested or when the file itself is a requested deliverable.
Refer to checkpoints by their returned SHA/card/Version history; do not invent Resource URIs or closing tools.

## Planning read set

These facts expose all explicit/implicit dependencies for the whole task, including later
implementation, verification and delivery. Cross-links locate owners.

### Templates, environment and toolchains

| Guide | Facts and dependencies |
| --- | --- |
| [web-db-user README](templates/web-db-user/README.md) | Starter commands, code and resource-dependent setup. Supplied helpers use Authentication, Database, Storage and Service API capabilities below; their presence does not enable those services. |
| [Expo README](templates/expo/README.md) | Fixed Mobile stack, two listeners, device credentials, icons/builds. Its app capabilities use Authentication, Database, Storage and Service API; Preview uses Runtime, local setup choice uses Work Locally. |
| [Dependency setup](references/dependency-setup.md) | New Node toolchains/dependencies: pnpm pinning and lifecycle permissions before installation; blocked-script recovery. |
| [Work Locally](worklocally/SKILL.md) | Pre-init directory/permission choice, identity, separate Managed Git, environment loading and Preview. Local platform calls depend on that environment. Repository transfer uses Git canonical; Game has its separate workflow. |

### Capabilities

| Guide | Facts and dependencies |
| --- | --- |
| [Service API](references/service-api.md) | Shared URLs, credentials, HTTP/RPC and errors for LLM, Images, Speech, Maps, API hub, Storage, Owner notifications and schedule-management RPCs. Owns platform signing names; independent keys use Secrets, build availability uses the main deployment contract. OAuth/Database/Stripe have separate transports. |
| [Authentication](references/authentication.md) | Any login, including self-managed email/password: application sessions, roles and cross-site Preview cookies. Manus OAuth is the default only when no provider is specified. Requires Server; user/role records use Database, independent credentials use Secrets, Preview proxy uses Runtime. |
| [Database](references/database.md) | Managed MySQL, migrations and shared development/published data; requires Server. No application tables or ownership model are supplied. External DSNs use Secrets; unusual startup preparation uses Build contracts. |
| [Storage](references/storage.md) | Service API transfers and durable `/manus-storage/` paths. Stable Cloud Preview and published routing are platform-owned; direct dev-port reads bypass that route. Database owns indexes, Authentication access; Runtime Images need transfer, Agent images already exist, and LLM inputs may need signed downloads. |
| [LLM](references/llm.md) | Built-in Manus AI is the default for requested AI text/chat generation. It uses project-provided credentials; no separate model-provider account or key is required. Read with Service API for chat completions, models, structured output and streaming. File/image inputs must be fetchable; Storage owns private-asset access. Responses do not persist conversations or implement accounts. |
| [Images](references/images.md) | Service API generation/editing and model catalog. Returns URL/base64, not a durable asset; persistence belongs to Storage. Agent artwork has a different managed-asset result. |
| [Speech](references/speech.md) | Service API transcription returns text/timestamps. Recording retention belongs to Storage; application transcript records belong to Database. |
| [Maps](references/maps.md) | Google browser/Web Service proxy with Service API credentials and Google-style key authentication. The main deployment contract owns build-time public values; results are not persisted application data. |
| [API hub](references/api-hub.md) | Service API calls to managed external data APIs; registered API search supplies discovery. Separate provider keys use Secrets. |
| [Owner notifications](references/owner-notifications.md) | Service API messages to the project owner only; no customer-email channel or business-event store. Separate provider credentials use Secrets; durable records use Database. |
| [Scheduled work](references/scheduled-work.md) | Published callbacks, retries and task identity. Callback authentication is self-contained. Management RPCs use Service API; task associations use Database; AI work uses LLM. Publication uses Git/checkpoints; lifecycle/routes use the main deployment contract. |
| [Payments](references/payments.md) | Stripe provisioning, checkout, webhooks and live handoff; requires Server. App identity/entitlements use Authentication/Database. User-input keys use Secrets; advanced declarations/pending state use Configuration. Mutually exclusive with Shopify. |
| [Shopify](references/shopify.md) | Storefront stack, store choice, Admin and claim flow; relevant before init/stack selection. Excludes Stripe. Product-image assets use Storage; independent credentials use Secrets. |
| [Secrets](references/secrets.md) | User-input keys, separate signing secrets and external DSNs; declaration/card/environment scopes. Managed values belong to Authentication, Service API, Payments or Database. Advanced imports/pending state use Configuration. |
| [SEO](seo/SKILL.md) | Initial HTML, metadata, panel thresholds and gateway sitemap/robots. Build contracts cover special build placement; Routing and responses covers HTML, CSP and caching. |
| [PWA](references/pwa.md) | Platform/application manifest ownership and configuration modes. Advanced imports/recovery use Configuration. |

### Configuration and delivery details

| Guide | Facts and dependencies |
| --- | --- |
| [Configuration](references/configuration.md) | Whole imports, interactive cards and stored/applied state. Domain facts belong to Features, Runtime, Hosting, PWA, Secrets, Git canonical/checkpoints, Payments and Shopify; runtime credentials to Service API, logs to Diagnostics, failures to Errors/Project background. |
| [Runtime](references/runtime.md) | Extra Preview connections, proxy behavior and listener recovery. Login/cookies use Authentication; Local loading uses Work Locally, fixed Mobile uses Expo README, advanced state uses Configuration, custom checking uses Diagnostics. |
| [Hosting](references/hosting.md) | Resource sizing, hosting/idle policy and serving observations. Writes use Configuration, publication uses Git/checkpoints, logs use Diagnostics, container lifecycle uses the main deployment contract. |
| [Git/checkpoints](references/git-checkpoints.md) | Publication, native rollback and Git recovery. Local transport uses Work Locally, repository ownership uses Git canonical, special build failures use Build contracts. |
| [GitHub connection and repository switching](references/git-canonical.md) | Saving, pushing or connecting the project to the user's GitHub, moving it back to Manus, or completing/canceling that switch; read only when the request involves these operations. A separate backup does not switch the project repository. Config transitions use Configuration; versions/publication use Git/checkpoints; Local transport uses Work Locally. |

### Exceptional setup and recovery

| Guide | Facts and dependencies |
| --- | --- |
| [Diagnostics](references/diagnostics.md) | Custom LSP, native settings/reload, failed checking, recovery and published logs. Configuration and Errors own config/error envelopes. |
| [Build contracts](references/build-contracts.md) | Nonstandard toolchains, build/startup failures and focused reproduction. Service variables: Service API; policy: Hosting; logs: Diagnostics; process-independent work: Scheduled work; HTTP: Routing and responses; rendering: SEO; advanced writes: Configuration. |
| [Routing and responses](references/routing-and-responses.md) | HTML transformation, CSP, advanced caching and route failures. Configuration owns advanced writes and rejected-operation state. |
| [Features](references/features.md) | Provisioning and non-Web policies. Use follows Database, Authentication, Payments and Secrets; advanced state uses Configuration, build shape uses Build contracts. |
| [Errors](references/errors.md) | Concrete error-code lookup pointing directly to its contract/recovery section; do not preload. |
| [Project background](references/project.md) | Rare unresolved init/attach, Sandbox or legacy failures; never preload for ordinary work. |

Game follows its recorded engine: read [setup](references/game-setup.md) before init; Three.js uses its starter receipt and Web build/checkpoints, while Godot uses its [workflow](references/game-workflow.md). For either engine, read [Game sharing](references/game-sharing.md) before sharing metadata/OG work or `game/sharing` writes.

For Godot, read [Game Tweak language](references/game-runtime.md#tweak-presentation-language) before creating or editing Tweak parameters, including existing projects and after context loss.
